Unit tests and integration tests are two different levels of testing in software development, each serving distinct purposes.

Unit Tests:
Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of a software system in isolation. A unit refers to the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class. The goal of unit testing is to verify that each unit works as intended and to catch any bugs or issues at the earliest stage of development. Unit tests are typically written by developers and executed frequently during the development process. They ensure that individual units perform correctly and help maintain code quality, making it easier to refactor and modify code without introducing new bugs.
Key characteristics of unit tests:

Isolated: Each test should run independently of other tests and the broader application.
Fast: Unit tests are meant to execute quickly, allowing for rapid feedback during development.
Focused: Tests should only verify the behavior of the specific unit under test, not the system as a whole.
Integration Tests:
Integration tests, on the other hand, assess how multiple units or components of a system work together. These tests aim to verify the interactions and interfaces between different parts of the application to ensure they integrate correctly and function as a cohesive unit. Integration testing helps identify issues that may arise when integrating individual components and validates the overall behavior of the system.
Key characteristics of integration tests:

Interaction: Integration tests involve testing multiple units or subsystems together.
Slower: Integration tests may take longer to execute compared to unit tests due to the complexity of testing multiple components simultaneously.
Realistic scenarios: These tests replicate real-world scenarios to ensure the system behaves as expected in a production-like environment.
